            The State of the Map European organizing committee, in collaboration
            with the OpenStreetMap Belgium community, is organizing the State of
            the Map Europe 2023 conference (SotM EU 2023) taking place on
            November 10th â€“ 12th in Antwerp, Belgium.
          </p>
          <p>
            State of the Map addresses and builds bridges between OSM mappers
            and community activists, open- source developers, researchers from
            universities and academic institutions, designers, cartographers, as
            well as GIS professionals from private and public institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This conference offers an opportunity for this diverse group of
            individuals, from various disciplines and backgrounds, to meet and
            exchange knowledge, experiences and plans for developing use and
            improvement of OSM. Around 400 attendees are expected to participate
            in this conference from Europe and from all over the world. The
            conference will be offered as a hybrid event, allowing additional
            participants to join via live- stream if they are unable to join
            in-person.

            OSMScience 2023 is a meeting focused on the scientific study of
            OpenStreetMap. Its 6th edition will be part of the State of the Map
            Europe 2023 conference where a full day of sessions will be
            dedicated to scientific research about, and with, OpenStreetMap.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of OSMScience 2023 is to showcase the research and
            innovation of scientific investigations into OpenStreetMap, while at
            the same time providing a bridge to connect members of the
            OpenStreetMap community and the scientific community through an open
            passage to exchange ideas and opportunities for increased
            collaboration. We expect empirical, methodological, conceptual, or
            literature-review-based contributions addressing any scientific
            aspect related to OpenStreetMap, in particular, but not limited to,
            data collection, integration and quality analysis in OpenStreetMap;
            contribution patterns and the human/social dimensions of the
            project; integration of machine learning and applications in which
            OpenStreetMap takes a central role.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an effort to improve the interaction and collaboration between
            the academic and the more general OpenStreetMap communities, authors
            are invited to particularly highlight the practical implications or
            impacts of their research on the OpenStreetMap community at large.

              State of the Map addresses and builds bridges between OSM mappers
              and community activists, open- source developers, researchers from
              universities and academic institutions, designers, cartographers,
              as well as GIS professionals from private and public institutions.

              This conference offers an opportunity for this diverse group of
              individuals, from various disciplines and backgrounds, to meet and
              exchange knowledge, experiences and plans for developing use and
              improvement of OSM. Around 400 attendees are expected to
              participate in this conference from Europe and from all over the
              world. The conference will be offered as a hybrid event, allowing
              additional participants to join via live- stream if they are
              unable to join in-person.

              OSMScience 2023 is a meeting focused on the scientific study of
              OpenStreetMap. Its 6th edition will be part of the State of the
              Map Europe 2023 conference where a full day of sessions will be
              dedicated to scientific research about, and with, OpenStreetMap.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of OSMScience 2023 is to showcase the research and
              innovation of scientific investigations into OpenStreetMap, while
              at the same time providing a bridge to connect members of the
              OpenStreetMap community and the scientific community through an
              open passage to exchange ideas and opportunities for increased
              collaboration. We expect empirical, methodological, conceptual, or
              literature-review-based contributions addressing any scientific
              aspect related to OpenStreetMap, in particular, but not limited
              to, data collection, integration and quality analysis in
              OpenStreetMap; contribution patterns and the human/social
              dimensions of the project; integration of machine learning and
              applications in which OpenStreetMap takes a central role.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an effort to improve the interaction and collaboration between
              the academic and the more general OpenStreetMap communities,
              authors are invited to particularly highlight the practical
              implications or impacts of their research on the OpenStreetMap
              community at large.

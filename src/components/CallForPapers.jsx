            Submission Types
          </h3>
          <h4 className="font-bold">Talk (20 minutes)</h4>
          <p>
            Classic talk of about 20 minutes for the talk itself followed by a
            question and answer session. This is the preferred submission type.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-bold">Extended Talk (40 minutes)</h4>
          <p>
            An extended talk with 40 minutes for the talk and 15 minutes for
            questions. These are for topics you want to explore in more depth.
            You should outline why your talk deserves more time.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-bold">Workshop (60–90 minutes)</h4>
          <p>
            Workshops are sessions in which the participants are actively
            involved, for example by following some steps on their own devices.
            We welcome workshops that cover basic beginners’s topics as well as
            innovative technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please communicate any requirements for participants in order to
            attend your proposed workshop regarding technical equipment. Please
            ensure that your participants shouldn’t be told to create an account
            at a business platform or a platform with user tracking. Or if so
            communicate that in an exposed way in your submission and provide
            guest accounts for your participants.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-bold">Panel Discussion (60-90 minutes)</h4>
          <p>
            Panels are for hot or controversial discussions around OSM
            community, mapping and data. Topics may cover for example diversity,
            legal questions or the future of the database. You should outline
            the format on how you intend to organise the discussion and make
            sure to invite the key players for the discussion. We welcome panels
            that include the audience. A designated moderator is therefore
            strongly recommended.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-bold">Other</h4>
          <p>
            Your submission does not fit into any of these submission types?
            Please get in touch with the programme committee via email (
            <Link className="font-bold" href="mailto:contact@stateofthemap.eu">
              contact@stateofthemap.eu
            </Link>
            ) before the end of the call for participation.

            Other session types
          </h3>
          <p>
            We plan to provide space for other session types which cannot be
            submitted in advance. Details will be announced before the
            conference.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-bold">Lightning Talk</h4>
          <p>
            Lightning talks will be short 5 minute talks. There will be some
            spaces for last-minute in-person talks. This will be announced
            separately.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-bold">Birds of a Feather</h4>
          <p>
            Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions are informal, spontaneous
            discussion rounds centered around a specific topic. It is not
            possible to submit a BoF session in advance.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-bold">Free Spaces</h4>
          <p>
            We will provide free spaces for working groups, local chapters,
            local groups, user groups for chitchat and more.
          </p>
          <h3 className="mx-auto mt-6 max-w-2xl text-center font-dunbar text-2xl font-medium tracking-tighter text-sotm-blue sm:text-3xl">
            Rating Criteria
          </h3>
          <p>
            In rating submissions, we will apply the following criteria:
            <ul className="ml-12 mt-4 list-outside list-disc space-y-4">
              <li>
                OSM as the subject: A submission where OSM is the main subject
                or an important ingredient will be rated higher than one that is
                more generic (e.g. a general talk about GIS software).
              </li>
              <li>
                Preference of &ldquo;open&rdquo;: A submission about open data
                and open source software will be preferred over one that deals
                with proprietary data or proprietary software and closed
                platforms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Preference of innovation: A submission about something new, or
                something not discussed at previous conferences, will be
                preferred over one that discusses more widely known issues
                (exception: OSM Basics).
              </li>
              <li>
                We are hoping for talks from a multitude of speakers and hence
                we would prefer accepting a talk from a &ldquo;new&rdquo;
                speaker over accepting a second talk from someone who has
                already an accepted talk.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will also try to avoid accepting too many talks from members
                of the same organisation.
              </li>
              <li>We prefer talks from members of underrepresented groups.</li>
              <li>
                We value transparency. We prefer submissions that disclose
                affiliations and sponsors of their work.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes we will make some changes or have suggestions:
            <ul className="ml-12 mt-4 list-outside list-disc space-y-4">
              <li>We might ask if several speakers can merge their talks.</li>
              <li>
                We might also ask if a change of format would be possible (for
                example we might suggest the lightning talk format instead of a
                regular talk when we find it is not enough content for a
                complete talk, but an interesting subject).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3 className="mx-auto mt-6 max-w-2xl text-center font-dunbar text-2xl font-medium tracking-tighter text-sotm-blue sm:text-3xl">
            Language
          </h3>
          <p>
            The conference language of State of the Map is English. All
            presentations shall be held in English. It is an important aspect of
            the conference that participants can interact with the speakers for
            questions and discussions. Non-English speaking participants are
            welcome to meet in the Birds of a Feather sessions.

            Publication
          </h3>

            Video recordings and slides of the lectures will be published under

            Tickets
          </h3>
          <p>
            State of the Map is a non-commercial event where neither the
            organisers nor the speakers are being paid. Speakers have to get a
            conference ticket just like everyone else. Details will be announced
            later.

            Programme Committee
          </h3>
          <p>
            Your submissions will be reviewed by a programme committee
            consisting of OpenStreetMap community members from various parts of
            the world:
            <ul className="ml-12 mt-4 list-outside list-disc">
              <li>Severin Menard</li>
              <li>Christine Karch </li>
              <li>Tomas Kasparek</li>
              <li>Ilya Zverev </li>
              <li>Sidorela Uku</li>
              <li>Seppe Santens</li>
              <li>Julien Minet</li>
              <li>Lorenzo Stucchi</li>
              <li>Stefan Keller</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The programme committee is aware of possible conflict of interest
            situations. We try to balance that in the composition of the
            committee. Nevertheless, we have imposed some rules upon ourselves
            to handle conflict of interest situations:
            <ul className="ml-12 mt-4 list-outside list-disc space-y-4">
              <li>
                We do not rate submissions from our workmates, clients or
                relatives.
              </li>
              <li>
                We act carefully and are aware about possible conflicts
                (especially the situation of horse trading). We act particularly
                carefully in cases associated to a sponsor.
              </li>
              <li>
                We communicate to other Programme Committee members when we are
                in a conflict of interest situation.
              </li>
              <li>
                We report any outside attempt of influencing their decisions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope this detailed &ldquo;Call for participation&rdquo; helps to
            increase the transparency of our programme selection process.

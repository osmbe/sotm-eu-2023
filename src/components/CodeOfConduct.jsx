            The OpenStreetMap Foundation is dedicated to providing a
            harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of
            gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
            disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
            We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any
            form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
            conference venue, including talks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures
            of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression,
            sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
            race, age, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate
            intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or
            recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
            inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
            comply immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
            activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
            particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
            or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
            sexualized clothing, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
            organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
            warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
            refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
            harassed, or have any other concerns that you are unable to
            satisfactorily resolve amongst the person(s) involved, please
            contact a member of conference staff immediately. Escalation to, and
            incident reporting by a small subset of conference team leaders will
            ensure that repeat offenders do not go unnoticed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference
            venues and conference-related social events.

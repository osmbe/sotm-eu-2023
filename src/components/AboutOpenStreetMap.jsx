              Founded in 2004, the OpenStreetMap community enables millions

              surroundings and neighborhoods.

              OpenStreetMap makes geospatial data available to everyone, for
              free, under an open license. It has revolutionized the way we see, use
              and sell mapping data and services. State of the Map enables this
              community to keep up to date with the ever-changing geospatial
              industry by providing opportunities to meet the wider community of
              software developers, volunteers and users.

Which of their projects could be scaled up to Europe? What would a Europe-wide collaboration look like? Is there any sense in formal organization?\n\nFor the first part, we intend to invite guests who are involved in these projects.\n\nSome context:\n* OSM Belgium has a small camera grant project (https://openstreetmap.be/en/projects/streetlevelimagery.html), financed by Corporate Membership. We are talking with Meta to roll this out towards all of Europe.\n* Our project to run a State of the Map Europe is intended to be a first run of something that might be a new bi-yearly tradition, especially considering the likelihood of more international SotM’s happening outside of Europa\n* After years of unfocused discussion, we started a simple Corporate Membership program (explained here: https://openstreetmap.be/en/support.html), which has been surprisingly successful (see https://github.com/osmbe/working-group-bylaws/tree/master/corporate-members). It hasn’t just given us some financial freedom, but also an opportunity to be present at expensive tech conferences (thank you Anyways.eu), support tile infrastructure (thank you Geo6.be) and increase our available manpower (thank you TomTom).\n* We try to build all our projects in a scalable way, though it is not always easy to help them grow elsewhere. Examples are the very succesful Welcome Tool (https://welcome.osm.be) and EqualStreetnames. But our Road Completion project (https://github.com/osmbe/road-completion) also runs on several areas.

How can this be achieved efficiently and at low cost ?\n\nAt Carto’Cité we designed and built the RTK360 kit, a low-tech solution that achieves this goal. It combines a 360° action cam such as the GoPro Max or Ricoh Theta Z1, together with the Sparkfun RTK Surveyor. RTK stands for Real Time Kinematic, this is a satellite navigation system (GNSS) that achieves centimeter-level accuracy by applying corrections provided by a reference station. Networks of RTK stations have existed for years, but they require costly equipment and a costly subscription to obtain the correction data.\n\nHowever this is changing now : the Centipede network is a freely accessible network of RTK stations that covers a large part of France and is quickly extending over Belgium, Switzerland, Hungary. This growth has been made possible thanks to RTKBase, an open source and open hardware RTK station designed by Stéphane PÉNEAU, an amazing maker and Carto’Cité associate. This means you too can build an RTK station and an RTK rover, and enjoy taking and sharing thousands and thousands of 360° pictures with centimeter-level accuracy.",

A first application is to provide information to the travelers about the accessibility of the railway platforms for bikes, in a dedicated route planner (BikeOnTrain Beta). In this talk, we’ll tell how and until where we’ve been so far.\nWe work on train station platform data and more specifically on their so-called accessibility objects: elevators, escalators, bike ramps, stairs, footways, etc. To our knowledge, it is the first time OSM data from train stations in Belgium was used in a specific application. More generally, we have also had the impression it is the first time a routeplanner gives a clear view to travelers on the different options to reach a platform.\nWhen we started the project, OSM data in the Belgian stations had varying degrees of completeness and quality. Fortunately, all train stations and 95% of the platforms were present in OSM. The quality of accessibility objects data was rather good, despite it is hard to quantitatively assess its completeness.\nWith the help of the Belgian OSM community and some paid jobbers, we gradually improve the OSM data by adding missing accessibility objects in railway platforms. Dissemination of information was made through a chat room, a wiki page, the writing of a tutorial and some OSM diary posts. We will share some tips and tricks learned from the field when mapping stations.\nThere are more mature examples of successful use of OSM data by railways companies, notably from France (SNCF). As train and OSM enthusiasts, we’d be excited about further development of practices around improving OSM data in railway stations. We also see a paved way for collaborations among railway companies for the use of OSM data.',

          "In the Lower Omo Valley in Ethiopia, a food security crisis is unfolding. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET), the situation in the area has passed ‘stressed’ to reach the ‘crisis’ stage. Against this background, we have been supporting a few affected agro-pastoralists\ncommunities in mapping the facilities and the natural resources, as part of an effort to better manage these resources and provide evidence to assess the scale of the disaster. The results from a pilot project (2021) demonstrate that the data generated by those affected is more accurate, complete, and locally relevant than authoritative maps or global machine-generated maps.\n\nThe Crowdmapping For Food Security in OMO Zone of Ethiopia Project aimed to support agro-pastoralist communities in mapping the natural resources and facilities they have access to and monitoring the state of such resources. The project further integrates the land user-generated data (in full or partially, depending on the communities’ decision) into OpenStreetMap.\n\nThe project also brought multiple groups together with distinct capabilities and knowledge, including OSM Ethiopia, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, YouthMappers, and the University College of London, who have come together to create the project's success. The project has already had a significant impact on the lives of those impacted by the food security crisis, improving circumstances and offering much-needed support. Furthermore, engaging and empowering youth to contribute to good change in their communities is a major goal of the project. This collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach has made it possible to achieve these goals.",

The community has always slowed down imports — without which it's impossible to get a good coverage. It treats shops and amenities tagging as an afterthought: proposals for these are much more rare than for linear features like power lines and railways. Mapping these has always been hard, and besides dozens of editors existing, only one does it good enough. Many important features, like freshness, get overlooked. And what about reviews and other community validation?\n\nIt's all too hard. Maybe we shouldn't even spend our time and thought on POI, and keep making the best base map for other companies to put POI on it?",

It was first created because neither Mapbox nor MapLibre had a Compose interface, which has become the default on Android.\n\nWe strive to maintain a nearly identical API between the Mapbox and MapLibre versions, ensuring effortless transition between the two.\n\nWhile Ramani-Maps supports standard static annotations such as markers, symbols, circles, polylines, and polygons, it emphasizes interactive map editing - an aspect often intricate in other libraries. Creating a user interface allowing users to define map areas (e.g. through interactive polygons) or paths (e.g. in a hiking app for planning routes) becomes remarkably simple with Ramani-Maps.\n\nAlthough the library is relatively new, it improves steadily. This presentation will show how Ramani-Maps works and what can be done with it.',

The proposed methodology combines AI-based semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to accelerate OSM data generation. The process involves selecting an image, segmenting objects, generating 3D patches, and translating them into OSM data. Testing and future work involve accuracy improvement and data integration challenges. This approach can enrich OSM, enabling diverse applications and addressing specific urban needs.",
